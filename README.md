# Project-1: TELEMART Clone
This is my first project after learning HTML & CSS in which I am trying to clone an E-Commerce website "TELEMART"

# Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to replicate the design of this website that helped me to practice various web development concepts like;
- Styling with CSS
- working with images and navigation menus

# Screenshots:
